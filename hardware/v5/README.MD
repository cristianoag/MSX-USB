# MSX-USB V5 PCBs

There are two folders for the PCBs abecause there are different types of CH376 modules available. Depending on the module you have, youâ€™ll need to use a specific version of the PCB. Compare the signals of your module with those on the PCBs to ensure you select the correct one.

## CHS376 Modules
### CH376S Module Type 1

The type 1 module can be recognized by the presence of a 6 position header on the left side of the module. The main header located at the bottom of the module has a configuration with the data signals located on the lower pins and the control signals on the upper pins.

The PCB that is suitable for the CH376S Module Type 1 has the appropriated signals configured appropriately to support the module. 

### CH376S Module Type 2

The type 2 module can be recognized by the presence of a 3 position header on the left side of the module. The main header located at the bottom of the module has a configuration with the data signals located on the upper pins and the control signals on the lower pins.

The PCB that is suitable for the CH376S Module Type 2 has the appropriated signals configured appropriately to support the module. 

## PCBs

Two versions of the PCB were created to support the two different modules on sale at this moment. You can download the Gerber files for each version of the PCB from the folders below.

## CPLD

The CPLD code for the MSX-USB v5 can be found in the [cpld](cpld) folder. The code is written in Verilog and can be compiled using the Quartus software from Intel. The code is compatible with the EPM7064SLC44-10 CPLD chip.
